# 🧪 BuilderIO Investigation

This project aims to evaluate the **capabilities and limitations of Builder.io** in a realistic front-end development workflow. The focus is on integrating Builder.io into an environment where a **custom design system** is already in place and the development process begins in **Figma**, then transitions to code through **Builder.io Fusion**.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Assess how Builder.io handles **integration with existing components**
- Test the **design-to-code** workflow using Figma and Fusion
- Explore the flexibility and maturity of Builder.io for modern development

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- [Builder.io](https://www.builder.io/) (including **Fusion**)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) as the design starting point

## 📝 Notes

- This is an **exploratory project**, not meant for production.
- The goal is to understand how well Builder.io adapts to real-world workflows where the UI is not entirely controlled by Builder, but instead integrates with an existing component architecture.
